# Progressive Web App: First Tasks

## Updates
Tasks data added in a txt file. Followed Mr. Rocco's in class example to add 5 additional tasks and subtasks. - Wayne 

## Overview

Create an app that focuses on organization. Creating tasks and organizing them by category. The app focuses on your tasks for one day at a time, so at the end of the day tasks will disappear and you will be able to start new lists the next day.
